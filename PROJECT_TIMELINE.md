# 📅 DispatchAI Project Timeline

**Status:** Phase 3 Complete (Operational Hybrid System)
**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Inception & UI (Completed)
**Goal:** Build a "Movie-Style" 911 Dashboard to validate the concept.

- [x] **Project Setup:** Initialized Next.js (Client) and FastAPI (Server) monorepo.
- [x] **Dashboard UI:** Designed the Dark Mode "Midnight Command" interface with Mapbox/Leaflet maps.
- [x] **The "Mock Brain":** Created `mock_service.py` to simulate AI responses (so we could build the UI without a GPU).
- [x] **WebSocket Engine:** Built the real-time communication layer (`ws://`) so the Map updates instantly.

## ✅ Phase 2: The "Hybrid" Architecture (Completed)
**Goal:** Replace the "Mock Brain" with Real AI using Google Colab's Free GPU.

- [x] **Colab Server:** Ported the AI Logic (Whisper, OpenSMILE, Mistral) to a Jupyter Notebook.
- [x] **Tunneling:** Implemented **Cloudflare Tunnel** to expose the Colab server to the public internet securely.
- [x] **Phone UI:** Built the mobile-responsive Caller Interface (`/phone`) to record audio.
- [x] **The Bridge:** Connected the Phone (Client) to Colab (Remote) via the Tunnel URL.

## ✅ Phase 3: Stabilization & Bug Fixes (Completed)
**Goal:** Make it actually work without crashing.

- [x] **The Audio Fix:** Debugged the `LibSndFileError`.
    - *Problem:* Browser sends WebM, OpenSMILE wants WAV.
    - *Fix:* Added FFmpeg conversion layer in Colab.
- [x] **The Loopback Fix:** Connected the Phone back to the Dashboard.
    - *Problem:* Dashboard didn't know a call was happening.
    - *Fix:* Added `colab_update` event handler in `server/main.py`.
- [x] **UI Polish:** Fixed "N/A Emotion" and "Wrong Time" bugs on the Dashboard.
- [x] **Documentation:** Wrote comprehensive README, Onboarding, and Spec guides.

## 🔮 Phase 4: Future Roadmap (To Do)
**Goal:** Turn this Prototype into a Production System.

### 1. Smart Voice Detection (Priority: High)
*   **Current:** Records for a fixed 7 seconds.
*   **Problem:** Cuts people off or records 5s of silence (causing hallucinations).
*   **Solution:** Implement **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to stop recording strictly when the user stops speaking.

### 2. Real Geocoding (Priority: Medium)
*   **Current:** Hardcoded locations or random points near San Francisco.
*   **Solution:** Integrate **Google Maps Places API**. When AI hears "Golden Gate Bridge", it should pin the *exact* GPS coordinates.

### 3. Database Persistence (Priority: Medium)
*   **Current:** Calls disappear when you refresh the page.
*   **Solution:** Save transcripts to `calls.db` (SQLite) so Dispatchers can review history later.

### 4. Multi-Agent Dispatch (Priority: Low)
*   **Idea:** Have specialized AI agents (Medical Expert, Police Negotiator) listen to the call and give specific advice to the Dispatcher.
